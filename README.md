Expiry date validation AI project 
goal: The objective of this Expiry Date Validation AI project is to help prevent products in the store from expiring by alerting store personnel each month about items approaching their expiry date. 
We plan to implement monthly pop-ups to notify about soon-to-expire products, allowing us to prioritize their sale before they go out of date.
Approach:
1.We use self-tags of products for identification.
2.During cycle counts, we manually enter the product quantities and upload the expiry date, as expiry information is not embedded in the barcodes.
3.We use OCR technology to decode information from product labels, allowing for accurate data entry and tracking.

The manual process required due to the lack of expiry information in barcodes.
